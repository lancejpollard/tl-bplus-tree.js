# B+Tree Examples

- `k` is a key store B+tree
- `v` is a key-value store B+tree
- `i` is an index based B+tree

These are from [@trincot](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5459839/trincot) on StackOverflow. Used as a reference implementation for various B+trees, with the added constraint that all arrays are powers of two sized, to optimize for memory layout.
